This software is intended for IOT sensors in remote outdoor environments.  It incorporates power management
and error mitigation techniques to ensure stability and resiliency.  These systems can run for years
without any direct interaction.  

I used a finite state machine approach and incorporates many suggestions from the Particle community
this code represents a communites expertise.
